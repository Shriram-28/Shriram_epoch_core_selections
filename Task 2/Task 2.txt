Task 2
I tried using both the alphabet_images dataset and alphabet_28x28.csv 
I could not perform task 2 as well as I could in task 1 cv and nn's were a little new to me so the models I made for classifying the Images didn't work well most of the architectures I tried either overfitted or underfitted I tried adding regularization to the models but it still overfit after different values.

I was able to implement the naive bayes model pretty well which is present in the sentiment analysis ipynb file 
It worked on 5 of 6 target images, I referred to stat quest youtube videos onNaive Bayes explained to understand the Naive aspect of it 
I implemented Naive Bayes  after looking at some towardsdatascience and medium articles.

I have submitted/added 3 parts of the task as different ipynb files 

The first one was image segmentation where I split the target images into grids to extract the charecters and save it in files 
The second one was the classification model
The third one was the sentiment analysis file 

Since my classification model failed I couldn't combine all these aspects into a refined notebook.
